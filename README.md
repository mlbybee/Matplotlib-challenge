Michelle Bybee-Moody Module 5 Challenge Assignment

Description:

This assignment includes creating a script as a data scientist at Pymaceuticals,Inc. At this company there was a request to work on data from a recent animal study. In this study, there were 249 mice that were identified with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) that were treated with with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

Observations and Insights:
    
    - The bar graph displays that the drug regimen Capomulin was tested on the maximum number of mice (~230), followed by Ramicane (~225). 
    - The male and female mice population was very similar - 50.2% male and 49.5% female mice in the study. This displays a balanced gender population for the study. 
    - From the information displayed in the statistics table and the box plots, we can infer that Capomulin and Ramicane treatments were more effective than other drugs. Treatment regimens selected for comparison: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.
    - From the study performed on a randomly selected mouse (b128) the individual line plot shows that the tumor size had a steady decline with few variations in growth in a period of 45 days. 
    - The correlation between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume is 0.88. This shows that when the mouse weight increases, the average tumor volume also increases. 
    - The regression analysis shows how much the average tumor volume will change when the mouse weight changes, with a positive slope regression line. This could be beneficial for predicting any future study outcomes.
